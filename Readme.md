While JavaScript is the language of the web, TypeScript (TS) provides several advantages that help improve the development experience, especially for larger and more complex applications.

Static Typing: TypeScript introduces optional static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch potential errors at compile-time rather than runtime, making code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

Enhanced Tooling and Autocompletion: TypeScript enhances IDE features like autocompletion, refactoring, and inline documentation. The compiler's type-checking capabilities make these tools more reliable, which increases productivity and reduces the chance of introducing bugs.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support: TypeScript provides features such as interfaces, classes, and inheritance, which make it easier to follow OOP principles and create more structured and maintainable code.

Backward Compatibility: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript. This makes it easy to integrate into existing JavaScript projects, progressively improving the codebase with types.

Future-Proof: TypeScript includes features from ECMAScript standards that may not yet be supported by all JavaScript engines. These features are transpiled to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and environments.

Features
Static Type Checking: Ensure that variables and function calls match the expected types.
ES6+ Features: Use the latest JavaScript features such as async/await, modules, destructuring, etc.
Object-Oriented Support: Includes features like classes, interfaces, and inheritance for better organization and reusability.
Tooling: Integration with modern IDEs for autocompletion, linting, and error-checking.
